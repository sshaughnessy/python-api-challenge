r^2 observations
1. r value indicates there is no significant relationship between latitude and cloudiness in the northern hemisphere.
2. r value indicates no significant relationship between windspeed and latitude in the northern hemisphere.
3. r value indicates no significant relationship between humidity % and latitude in the northern hemisphere. 

general observations
1. highest temps occur near the equator
2. southern hemisphere wind speed mildly correlated to latitude (r^2 =.16), which may be related to the wide swaths of open ocean in the southern hemisphere
3. based on the southern and nothern hemisphere regressions, it doesn't seem like you can escape humidity
